# Dairy-Goods
Exploratory Data Analysis of dairy goods sales

This dataset was obtained on Kaggle.
The dataset have 23 columns 

But we are going to focus on these columns
Date, Product ID, Product Name, Brand, Quantity (liters/kg), Price per Unit, 
Total Value, Shelf Life (days), Storage Condition, Production Date, Expiration Date, Quantity Sold (liters/kg),
Price per Unit (sold), Approx. Total Revenue (INR), Customer Location, Sales Channel, Quantity in Stock (liters/kg),
Minimum Stock Threshold (liters/kg) and Reorder Quantity (liters/kg)

In this analysis, metrics such as sales by brand, shelf life, and product preference are analyzed based on the location 
where they are sold and the distribution channel.

We can analyze where does each brand sell more and which product in general, it could be helpful to understand which channel is 
the one people buys more from so the brand could invest more effort in that channel. Additionally, here we can see that all of 
the brands have presence in all the locations, understanding the distribution trend of the brands.

In this heatmap we can see patterns on the average shelf life day in different locations and distribution channels between brands, 
there are products that do not vary that much, for example the yogurt or the curd. But for example, the milk, that could vary from 
1.2 days to 25.8 days just by changing location.

Now we can understand which are those products that vary their Shelf Life, more than the brand we can start thinking that what afects
more the Shelf Life is probably the storage method.

Now there is visual evidence to understan why milk or cheese vary, in fact it could be the storage condition, having tetra pack and 
polythene packet for milk, and refrigerated and frozen for cheese, something unexpected is that frozen condition for cheese have a 
lower average shelf life. Finally, the ghee that was the last of the three that have variations on the shelf life, this product storage 
is ambient, even though all productsÂ´ shelf life could vary because of transportation to the location this product could be more affected 
by the location because of the wheter in each location.

Here we can analyze which product is the one people tend to buy the most, additinally, with the heatmap and the bar plot is evident 
which city is the one that spends the most on this kind of goods in general, the reason of this could be the size of the population 
or the purchasing power.
